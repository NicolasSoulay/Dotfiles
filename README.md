# Dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repository.

## Installation

This configuration is meant to be used on a base install (no desktop environment, no window manager, no graphical user interface) of debian 12 Bookworm.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NicolasSoulay/Dotfiles
./Dotfiles/install/install.sh
```

## Todo

- add an update script
- document each configurations
- document global workflow and shortcuts
